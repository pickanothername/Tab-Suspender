	If you like to use many open Tabs at once - this extension will help you and accelerate your browser and purge the
	memory.

	Extension suspend, park, hibernate inactive tabs and save up to 80% of memory.

	Unloading tabs will free memory and reduce load on the device, saving battery and less heat.

	This extension catches inactive, idle or forgotten tabs and suspend / park them with the freeing 80% memory, device
	resources and battery life.

	When tab became a visible again, it would be automatically restored to initial.

	Also you can enable intellectual tab closing module, which holds count of tabs at the specified level.

	Benefits:

	Speeds Up Chrome:
	Suspended tabs don't consuming
	processor resources.

	Minimize Memory Use:
	Chrome consumes in 3-5 times less
	memory with suspended tabs
	against normal.

	Automatic controls tab population:
	Do not need to close unused tabs
	manually.

	TODO'S:

	Proposals
	==========================================================================================
	1) When a tab is suspended, Chrome still manages it as a separate process with associated memory allocated. Although
	the memory utilisation drops, having lots of suspended tabs is still consuming substantial RAM from what I have
	observed. It would be useful to have a sequence of suspension steps with different time intervals associated to them.
	Something like: 1. Suspend tab (as today) - tab remains visible but whited out 2. Tab removed to list - tab is removed
	and placed as a thumbnail onto a dedicated tab owned and managed by Tab Suspender (this is where the process and
	memory saving would kick in to the greatest extent). 3. Archived - after an extended period (days, weeks or months)
	'tab' is removed from the above list and forgotten altogether or buried in an archive list. Aside from the above
	suggestion, it would also be of benefit to be able to set the Tab Close interval to a much higher value than one day
	eg. x weeks or months. (I, like many others I am guessing, have tabs open in some browsers for over a year!)
	Add comments:
	A Google User Looks like I was somewhat mistaken in my understanding of the way things are working. I was observing
	Chrome processes in the Windows Task Manager, but just discovered the Chrome Task Manager and see that the suspended
	tabs appear to be grouped into a small set of processes. From a UI perspective, I still would find it useful to have
	the longer-standing suspended tabs moved off to a thumbnail list though, to de-clutter the tab bar without losing them
	altogether. This may still also reduce memory utilisation of the shared process also. The suspended tabs I see now (10
	of) are grouped into two processes consuming a total of 222MB of RAM - not to be sneezed at.
